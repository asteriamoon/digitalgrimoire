 Welcome to the Digital Grimoire, a comprehensive and evolving repository of magickal correspondences. This project serves as a reference bank, primarily for my personal use, but also as a resource for other practitioners and anyone interested in the study and practice of magick. The content here is meticulously curated to provide reliable information to help you craft your own spells, rituals, or simply to deepen your understanding of magickal correspondences.

  ## Contents
Currently, the Digital Grimoire focuses on providing an extensive collection of correspondences, which are the building blocks of many magickal practices. In the future, I plan to expand this grimoire to include spells and rituals that complement the correspondences.

   ## Usage Instructions
This grimoire is organized in a simple markdown format for ease of use. You can navigate through the different sections by browsing the markdown files within the repository. As the content grows, I may introduce a folder structure to categorize correspondences more effectively, making it easier to find specific information.
